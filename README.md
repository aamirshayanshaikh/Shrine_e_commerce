# MDC-100 Series of Codelabs

Material Components for Flutter (MDC-Flutter) unite design and engineering with a library of components that create a consistent user experience across apps and platforms. As the Material Design system evolves, these components are updated to ensure consistent pixel-perfect implementation, adhering to Google's front-end development standards. MDC is also available for Android, iOS, and the web.

In this codelab, you'll build a login page using several of MDC Flutter's components.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## What you'll build
This codelab is the first of four codelabs that will guide you through building an app called Shrine, an e-commerce app that sells clothing and home goods. It will demonstrate how you can customize components to reflect any brand or style using MDC-Flutter.

In this codelab, you'll build a login page for Shrine that contains:

* An image of Shrine's logo
* The name of the app (Shrine)
* Two text fields, one for entering a username and the other for a password
* Two buttons, one for "Cancel" and one for "Next"
